                                     <p>The Jubilee Austen project was an exercise that envoled creating a basic website from Photoshop Design Comp. HTML5 structural tags were used, and all fonts, colors, and dimensions were pulled from Photoshop. This template would be perfect for a freelace photographer or designer, and it could be easily expanded to accomidate a portfolio of work.</p>

                                <h5>HTML &amp; CSS Project</h5>
                                    <p>The Rogue Pickings website was created from a Photoshop Design Comp. The one page site is a great starting point for a small business looking to freshen up its online presence. The navigation could be customized and expanded, and pages could be added to create an extensive site featuring menus, reviews and locations.</p>

                            <p>I started taking Skillcrush web development classes as a creative outlet from my administrative job, and I got hooked. After going through an extensive website redesign at work, I realized how much of a difference a well desiged, well branded website could make. I am excited to be on the other side of the table this time and have the opportunity to create beautifully designed websites. <br><br> On a personal note, I live in Columbus, Ohio with my husband and two wonderful kids. The kids keep me busy with their sports and social calendars, and I use the rest of my freetime to take classes and keep my skills current. </p>
